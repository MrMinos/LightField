      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>This simulation can aid in product advertisement or realtor business, to help the potential buyers to look and even estimate the feel of home/product, more accurately in their desired settings. One static example is IKEA and their catalog. We want to build an interactive simulator that users could control and experience themselves.
	</p>
	<br>
	<br>
      <h3>Goals and Deliverables</h3>
      <h4>What we <em>want</em> to deliver</h4>
      <p>We want to generate an interactive simulation of a residential home where users can modify the furnitures, including the placement of lighting, in a home. We believe we can accomplish this goal because there are existing libraries that we can use to achieve our goal</p>

      <p>We want to create something like this(link) example, where a prospective tenant can check and see how their home will look like with their desired settings.</p>

      <h4>What we <em>hope</em> to deliver</h4>
      <p>We would like to take this simulator and have some sort of characters with physics engine. This will allow users to engage with the scene more interactively and gain realistic experiences. For example, users can host a party in their home see </p>

      <h4>Quality / Performance Measurements</h4>
      <p>We will measure the quality of our system by having individuals use our application and we will ask them about their experience and if it meets their expectations. Moreover, we will include a quantitative measurement to determine the user experience</p>
